## Introduction

The Game Recommendation System is designed to help users discover new games that align with their interests. It analyzes user behavior and preferences to make personalized game suggestions.

## Features

- **User Preferences**: Takes into account user preferences and behavior to make tailored suggestions.
- **Python Implementation**: Built entirely in Python, making it easy to understand and customize.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Game-Recommendation-System.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Game-Recommendation-System
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
**Data Preparation:**
- Gather user data and game preferences in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database).
- Ensure the data includes user IDs, game IDs, and user ratings or interactions.

**Running the System:**
- Use the recommend_games.py script to run the recommendation system.
- Provide the necessary data files or database connections as arguments.

**Interpreting Results:**
- The system will output a list of recommended games for each user based on their behavior and preferences.

## Example

```bash
python recommend_games.py --user_data users.csv --game_data games.json
```
This will run the recommendation system using user data from users.csv and game data from games.json.
